# Unity.RestClient 
## Part of the open source Unity.Framework for Crestron

Crestron SIMPL# library for making calls to a REST API over HTTP. 

## Usage
Your main class should inherit from RestClient, and the Simpl+ module should set it's HostName property.

Individual API calls should be individual classes inheriting from ApiObject.
